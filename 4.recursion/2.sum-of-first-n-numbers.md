```js
function sum(n) {
  if (n === 0) return 0;
  return n + sum(n - 1);
}

console.log(sum(5));
```

let me explain this code

when sum(5) is called it check 5 === 0, no then it returns 5 + sum(4), and it will go like this till sum(0). i Will show how the call stack will be

```js
0;
1 + sum(0);
2 + sum(1);
3 + sum(2);
4 + sum(3);
5 + sum(4);
sum(5);
```

after reaching this step then it will come back. so now. it will come from top to bottom.
it found that sum(0) is 0
sum(1) is 1 + sum(0) = 0 => 1
sum(2) is 2 + sum(1) = 1 => 3
sum(3) is 3 + sum(2) = 3 => 6
sum(4) is 4 + sum(3) = 6 => 10
aum(5) is 5 + sum(4) = 10 => 15

and its the last step and it will return 15
