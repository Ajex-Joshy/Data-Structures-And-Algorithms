### 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future
to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

The first logic coming to your mind is that by using nested loop and find each day profit and updating the largest profit. But this will have the time complexity of n^2. so we need an another logic

The logic is that we will find the max profit of each day. And we will return the highest profit.

let me explain in detail with example

prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

we will find what will the max profit on each day.
suppose if we sell the stock on third day.
we can buy the stock on first and second day.

if I buyed on first day i will have profit of -2
if i buyed on second day my profit will be 4.

so if sell on 3rd day my max profit will 4, that I bought on 2nd day

so the method is we will subtract the the price of each day by the min price of the stock that is before of that day

# Intuition

The goal is to maximize profit by buying and selling a stock once.  
To achieve this, we need to find the smallest buying price and the largest selling price that comes after it.  
By tracking the minimum price seen so far and comparing each day’s price against it, we can compute the potential profit at every step and store the maximum profit found.

# Approach

1. Initialize `min` as `Infinity` to represent the minimum price seen so far.
2. Initialize `maxProfit` as `0` to store the best profit found.
3. Loop through each price in the array:
   - If the current price is less than `min`, update `min` (this is a better buying price).
   - Otherwise, calculate the profit by `prices[i] - min` and if it’s greater than `maxProfit`, update `maxProfit`.
4. After the loop, return `maxProfit`.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $$O(n)$$ — We traverse the array only once.
- **Space complexity:** $$O(1)$$ — We use only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let min = Infinity;
  let maxProfit = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    if (prices[i] < min) min = prices[i];
    if (prices[i] - min > maxProfit) maxProfit = prices[i] - min;
  }
  return maxProfit;
};
```
